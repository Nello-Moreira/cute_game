# Cute game
This is a simple game I made as a joke for my girlfriend. The goal is to collect as many hearts as possible as the difficulty increases throughout the game.

As I said, it was just for fun, but some more features could be implemented, for example, a score history.

### How to run
To play this game, you need to install pygame by running this command: 
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After installation is complete, just run the "play_game.py" file:
```bash
python3 play_game.py
```
